For the extension to work, you have to install the language server `grizzly-loadtester-ls` which is published on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/grizzly-loadtester-ls/).

Install it with:

```bash
python -m pip install grizzly-loadtester-ls
```

And make sure it's in a directory that is part of your `PATH` environment variable.
