# grizzly-ls

This is the LSP server implementation for Visual Studio Code extension [`biometria-se.grizzly-loadtester-vscode`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biometria-se.grizzly-loadtester-vscode).

It provides the logic for auto-completion of step expressions for your `grizzly-loadtester` project.

Big shout out to [`pygls`](https://pypi.org/project/pygls/) for making the implementation of a LSP server easy!
